# A
False.

Let `x` be 1, `y` be `INT_MIN` or in antoher word `- INT_MIN`.

`-1 > INT_MIN` is true, but `1 < INT_MIN` is false.

$x=1$

# B
True.

`((x + y) << 4) + y - x == 16 * (x + y) + y - x == 17 * y - 15 * x`.

# C
True.

Since we know that for all `x`, `-x` equals `~x + 1`.

`~x + ~y + 1 == (-x - 1) + (-y - 1) + 1 == - 1 - x - y`.

`~(x + y) == -(x + y) - 1 == - 1 - x - y`.


# D

True.

The casting between `signed` and `unsigned` makes no difference.

`ux - uy == x - y`.
`-(y - x) == x - y`.

# E
True.

Doing `(x >> 2) << 2` on an `x` is equivalent to clearing the least and second-least significant bits, which certainly can't make `x` larger.
